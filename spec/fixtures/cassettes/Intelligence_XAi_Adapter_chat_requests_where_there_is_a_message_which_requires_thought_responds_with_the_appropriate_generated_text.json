I must answer succinctly and in the requested format without any additional text.\\n\\nFrom my knowledge, a 30-60-90 triangle is a special right triangle with side ratios of 1 : √3 : 2, where:\\n\\n- The side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest, let's call it x.\\n\\n- The side opposite the 60-degree angle is x√3.\\n\\n- The hypotenuse, opposite the 90-degree angle, is 2x.\\n\\nGiven that the hypotenuse is 6, so 2x = 6.\\n\\nSolving for x: x = 6 / 2 = 3.\\n\\nSo, the shortest side is x, which is 3.\\n\\nNow, the system prompt says to always provide the text in the requested format without any additional text. But in this query, there's no specific format requested beyond being succinct. Looking back at the prompt: \\\"answer succinctly and always provide the text in the requested format without any additional text.\\\"\\n\\nIn this message, the user didn't explicitly request a format. However, in the initial system prompt, it might imply that I should just give the answer directly. To be safe, I should just output the number or the answer plainly.\\n\\nRe-reading the system prompt: \\\"It is very important that you answer succinctly and always provide the text in the requested format without any additional text.\\\"\\n\\nBut in this user message, no format is requested. Perhaps I should assume that the format is just the answer itself.\\n\\nIn the context of a test platform, probably they expect just the numerical answer.\\n\\nSo, I should output: 3\\n\\nBut to confirm, let's think about the triangle properties. Yes, hypotenuse 6, so shortest side is half of that in a 30-60-90 triangle, which is 3.\\n\\nAnswer is 3.\\n\\nNow, for the response, since it says \\\"without any additional text,\\\" I should not say things like \\\"The length is 3\\\" or anything; just \\\"3\\\".\\n\\nBut typically in such platforms, they might expect the unit or something, but here it's just length, no unit specified.\\n\\nPerhaps I should box it or something, but the prompt doesn't say.\\n\\nThe system prompt says: \\\"put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.\\\"\\n\\nIn the initial system prompt, it says: \\\"Make sure to put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}.\\\"\\n\\nLooking back: In the conversation history, it's not shown, but in standard setups, sometimes it's specified.\\n\\nIn this text, it's not explicitly stated in the provided message, but perhaps it's implied.\\n\\nRe-reading the system prompt: \\\"You are integrated into a test platform. It is very important that you answer succinctly and always provide the text in the requested format without any additional text.\\\"\\n\\nBut it doesn't specify the format here. However, in many AI response formats, especially for math problems, we use \\\\boxed{} to denote the final answer.\\n\\nTo be precise, I should check if the user requested a format. They didn't.\\n\\nBut to follow best practices, I'll assume that I need to provide the answer in a boxed format as is common.\\n\\nPerhaps the \\\"requested format\\\" refers to whatever the user might specify, but here it's not specified, so just plain.\\n\\nBut in the system prompt, it might be implied.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the initial setup, it says \\\"put your final answer within \\\\boxed{}\\\", but in this text, it's not written. Perhaps I need to infer.\\n\\nTo be safe, I'll provide the answer as a number, and since it's a math context, I'll use \\\\boxed{3}.\\n\\nBut the prompt says \\\"provide the text in the requested format\\\", and no format is requested, so maybe just \\\"3\\\".\\n\\nHowever, to match the typical response, I'll go with \\\\boxed{3}.\\n\\nFinal answer is 3.\",\"refusal\":null},\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":78,\"completion_tokens\":5,\"total_tokens\":889,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"text_tokens\":78,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"image_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":77},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":806,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":0,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":0},\"num_sources_used\":0},\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_4e23a495a9\"}"
