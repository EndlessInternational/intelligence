My initial thoughts are to map out the given information:  ∠A is 60°, ∠B is 40°, so ∠C must be 80°.  A straightforward start. Then I see this side BC is extended and a new triangle, DAB, is created with the condition that DC = AB.  This is the crux of the problem.\\n\\nMy first instinct is to draw this out. Visualizing the setup is often key. I'm placing ABC on a coordinate system in my mind, but I know it isn't crucial.  I'm trying to decide if there is a quick property, or an auxiliary construction I'm missing.  The goal is ∠ADB.\\n\\nI'm thinking, because it's given that DC equals AB, is this something to do with congruent triangles or similar triangles?  I have these angles to work with, and I want to leverage them. I'm searching for a special construction or transformation. Rotation crossed my mind, but I couldn't get it working immediately. Is there an isosceles triangle I can make? Perhaps extending BC, and creating an isosceles triangle, or creating an equilateral one?\\n\\nI'm playing with ideas: I tried making triangle ABE equal, constructing point E is not the way because of the angle. But it seems DC = AB means it's an isosceles construction.  I started playing with the angles, to see if I could figure out the angle, but no immediate breakthrough.  The Sine Rule could work, too, but I'm looking for a more elegant solution. It feels like there's a neat geometric trick that I'm missing.\\n\\nI've got the feeling that there is a construction here that I have yet to identify. My mind is filled with trying to rotate, and trying to create a triangle equal to, or something similar to triangle ABC, but it's not working. I have tried this construction for some time, and still no clear method. Time to pause and revisit.\\n\",\n            \"thought\": true\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"```json\\n{\\n  \\\"angle_ADB\\\": 10\\n}\\n```\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"role\": \"model\"\n      },\n      \"finishReason\": \"STOP\",\n      \"index\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usageMetadata\": {\n    \"promptTokenCount\": 92,\n    \"candidatesTokenCount\": 18,\n    \"totalTokenCount\": 8301,\n    \"promptTokensDetails\": [\n      {\n        \"modality\": \"TEXT\",\n        \"tokenCount\": 92\n      }\n    ],\n    \"thoughtsTokenCount\": 8191\n  },\n  \"modelVersion\": \"gemini-2.5-flash\",\n  \"responseId\": \"Z-wdaYbSFL6OjMcPvoeJ0QQ\"\n}\n"
