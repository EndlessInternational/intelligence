In the beginning, there was a singularityâ€”an infinitesimally small, hot, and dense point. 
Approximately 13.7 billion years ago, this singularity expanded in a monumental event known 
as the Big Bang, giving birth to the universe as we know it. Time and space unfurled, leading 
to the formation of subatomic particles, atoms, and eventually, the vast array of celestial 
bodies that populate the cosmos today. From that primordial explosion emerged galaxies, stars, 
planets, and the intricate tapestry of life, all evolving over billions of years into the 
complex and wondrous universe we observe now.
